In this lab, my goal was to show the nearest tennis court to a school in Ottawa. When I was growing up I really enjoyed plyaing tennis after school and didn't realize there was a tnenis court in a culdesac near my high school ( i did go to the one closer to my high school that I knew existed). This map is meant for k-12 students who want to pick up a racket when their classes let out. 

These are a few of the sources I used:
https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/popup-on-click/

https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/analysis-with-turf/


I made the map in a way that you would choose the school and the nearest tennis court would be highlighted. I chose a simple basemap that showed the roads, but just in case that wasn't clear I also added a description for the tennis court that you would click and the address would pop up. 

Some of the issues with the data is there were quite a few unidentifiable tennis parks that neitehr containd name or address. I understand that not all parks have names, but I think the missing addresses is weird. Aside from data, I think ways that this map could improve is automatic pop ups when you click on the school the tennis court pop up would be triggered, although this causes another issue which is the overlap of the pop ups because some of these poitns are quite close to each other. I think if i were to do this map over, I would have it so that clicking on certain points would recenter the map. 


In the following images I show that when you click on a school the nearest tennis court is highlighted, and in the follow up image you must click on the tennis court to reveal the information about that park.
